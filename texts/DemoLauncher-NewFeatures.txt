 executed

-The maximum length of all filepaths is checked now

-Timer is stopped everytime if the running demo with an exit possibility
 to return to the system (via the left/right mousebutton) is quit before
 the playtime ends

-If the last running demo has an exit possibilty to return to the system,
 the Demo Launcher is removed out of memory if it was quit before the

-AGA 020 startmode: The routine to turn the 68030/040/060 MMUs off before
 the demo starts is re-implemented and improved. Some nasty old AGA demos
 like "Polka Bothers - Friday at eight" or "Andromeda - Nexus7" should
 work now even on 68060 machines. In this mode, demos should generally run
 at full speed not slowed down like before.
