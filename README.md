# Make your own demo show with the Amiga Demo Launcher !!!

Create a resident playback queue of your favorite OCS/ECS/AGA file demos and
play them in a very comfortable way

exe files and WHDLoad files supported

With the reset device plugged into the serial port and some minor soldering
you change your Amiga to a Demo Launcher machine

Use the Arexx tool CreateDemoPlaylist to create playlists fast and easy

Several startmodes work as a degrader to make old OCS intros run on AGA Amigas

Set a play duration for each entry. After the play time is counted down,
the reset device does an automatic reset and the next entry is played
